            <p>Core Growth is an industry-specific leadership program designed for emerging clean water utility leaders whose span of influence and impact is growing in a meaningful way. Core Consulting has designed the six-month program using Wiley’s Work of Leaders as a framework for a curriculum that moves through four modules (self, vision, alignment and execution) with a variety of interactions, speakers, and experiences.</p>

            <p>Core Growth operates on a regional cohort model, with several utilities in the same region sending two to four participants (total class size of 15–20). Four of these utilities also commit to hosting one of the program’s on-site workshops and facility tours. The next session of Core Growth will take place in early 2020, and the process of forming the cohort is going on now. Please contact us to learn more about joining this next session!</p>

            <p>We’ve seen a host of positive outcomes for Core Growth participants since the program’s inception in 2017. Here’s what our graduates say they are better equipped to do after completing the program:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Move from idea to action to results</li>
              <li>Rally and inspire others to action (sometimes with no formal authority)</li>
              <li>Craft bold visions of “what can be”</li>
              <li>Build stronger relationships</li>
              <li>Connect the dots from strategy to tactical execution</li>
              <li>Value diversity and work best with others</li>
            </ul>

            <p>On the whole, participants also report greater confidence and self-awareness.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center mb-5">Through Core Growth, Your Emerging Leaders Will:</h2>

        <h3>Identify their personal leadership styles.</h3>
        <p class="mb-5">Using the Everything DiSC and Gallup’s Strengths Finder assessments, they will gain a strong sense of self by learning about their leadership styles and strengths. Assessment results will help them discover the value in individual differences while also teaching tactics for working with other styles and skill sets.</p>

        <h3>Learn from other utility leaders.</h3>
        <p class="mb-5">Executive leaders from the hosting utility will give advice at each workshop. Participants will also
        select a mentor from their own utility to meet with monthly. These mentors will offer leadership
        guidance and assist with individual development plans.</p>

        <h3>Collaborate with peers.</h3>
        <p class="mb-5">All Core Growth participants are clean water utility professionals from your geographic region. The
        strategic makeup of the class allows participants to share knowledge of the region, exchange ideas
        or connections, and ignite ongoing collaborative relationships.</p>

        <h3>Solve clean water utility issues.</h3>
        <p class="mb-5">They will build upon the four modules of the program (self, vision, alignment, and execution) to
        complete an industry-specific capstone project. This capstone project will explore real challenges in
        the clean water utility industry and will use the collective expertise of the program participants to
        develop solutions.</p>
